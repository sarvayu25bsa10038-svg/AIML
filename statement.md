# Project Statement  
My Shop Thing – shop.py

### Problem Statement
Every small kirana / general store owner faces the same daily headaches:
- Writing bills by hand → mistakes in addition, change, GST
- Forgetting current stock → either “out of stock” or “extra stock rotting”
- No record of what was sold and at what profit
- Excel crashes, big software costs ₹15,000–50,000 + yearly fees
- Most shopkeepers (50–70 years old) can’t learn complicated systems

We needed something that:
- Works on the same old laptop behind the counter
- Takes less than 5 minutes to learn
- Never loses data even when light goes
- Costs exactly ₹0 forever

### Scope of the Project
A single Python script (shop.py) + one tiny data file (stuff.json) that completely replaces:
- Stock register
- Bill book
- Calculator
- Daily sales khata

No server, no internet, no monthly payment, no installation headache.

### Target Users
- Kirana / general store owners
- Medical shops
- Stationery shops
- Hardware shops
- Any dukaan where uncle/nephew sits and sells 50–500 items per day
- Age group: 15 to 75 (yes, my 68-year-old mama uses it daily)

### High-level Features
1. Add / Edit / Delete items with quantity & price
2. Lightning-fast search (type 2–3 letters → item appears)
3. Point-of-sale billing (just type item name → quantity → “done”)
4. Automatic stock deduction after every sale
5. 18% GST calculation + clean bill display
6. All data saved instantly after every single change
7. Works completely offline
8. Survives power cuts (saves on every action)
9. Backup = copy one small JSON file to phone
10. Runs on Windows 7, 8, 10, 11 (tested for 5+ years)
